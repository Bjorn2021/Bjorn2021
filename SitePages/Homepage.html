                <h2>A bit more about me!</h2>
                <p> Salutations, my name is Ricardo Acosta, a software engineer based in Orlando, Florida, with a passion for technology and creativity. I revel in the world of video games and programming, as well as an interest in outdoorsmanship. My interests extend to 3D printing and Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA), reflecting my love for both technological innovation and tradition. </p>
                <p> Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm an avid fan of fiction, with a particular fondness for the sprawling narratives of the "Sprawl" and "Witcher" series. My interests also delve into the realms of cyberpunk and dark fantasy, evident from my Berserk tattoo, a symbol of my affinity for this genre. Among my favorite films is "Conan the Barbarian," which complements my taste in entertainment that spans heavy metal bands like Dio and Judas Priest, to the synth-wave sounds of Power Glove and Gunship, and even rap music from artists like Kendrick Lamar and Kid Cudi. </p>
                <p> When I'm not coding or lost in my favorite books and music, you might find me engaged in airsoft battles, practicing MMA, or experimenting with new designs in 3D printing. You can explore some of my projects on my GitHub repository, where I share my work and collaborate with peers. </p>
